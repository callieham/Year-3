In the function Part1, the list is split into 2 parts with the first part being searched using an Insertion Sort, and the second part being searched using a Binary Insertion Sort. The input $i^*$ is the index of the list at which it swaps from the Insertion Sort to the Binary Insertion Sort method. How we set $i^*$ determines the computational cost of the function. If we set $i^*$ to 0, we get the function only using the Binary Insertion Sort algorithm which has a computational cost of $O(Nlog_{2}(N))$, since each Binary Search is $O(log_{2}(N))$ and N of these are completed. This computational cost is better than if we set $i^*$ to N-1, where we get our worst case cost of $O(N^2)$, as seen when using the Insertion Sort algorithm in lectures. Between these values, the
